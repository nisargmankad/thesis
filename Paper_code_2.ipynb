The failure to change the emergency directives is intended to leave more room for action while the security discussions will continue. There is also an attempt to understand what Israel might gain from the delay - For example, the possibility of promoting a significant strategic alliance in the region with the US.\\n\\nAlready yesterday at 11:00 p.m., when dozens of drones and missiles were making their way towards Israel, the dispute over the issue began within the War Cabinet. Ministers Gantz and Eisenkot demanded immediate action, at the same time as the attack, fearing that after it and when the results became clear, international pressure would be placed on Israel: \"We must not wait, we must react now.\"\\n\\nDefense Minister Galant, Chief of Staff Halevi and the other cabinet ministers opposed - for operational reasons and due to the required coordination with the US.

It didn't require any unique intelligence work: Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said so himself publicly, three times. The Iranians emphasized that the fact that a building next to its embassy in Damascus, which they claim served as their consulate, was attacked, meaning that the strike constituted an attack on its sovereign territory.\\n\\n>It was at this point that extensive preparations began, leaning on the strategic regional architecture built up over the past three years. The Biden Administration, in close cooperation with Israeli, pushed forward with a plan for a regional defense umbrella against drones and missiles with the cooperation of European countries and several Sunni states in the region.\\nThe system relies on a network made of sensors deployed in different countries. Israel contributed advanced discovery and interception capabilities through its multi-layer defense systems. The other partners initially contributed radars deployed close to Iran's border. Throughout the first six months of the war, there have been various signs of the work of the regional defense system, dubbed by the Americans as MEAD (Middle East Air Defense Alliance).\\nThe fruits of this alliance were evident in full for the first time in the early hours of Sunday morning. The Iranians fired over 300 drones and missiles of various types with only minimal success. A few ballistic missiles fell in open areas, mostly in the Negev in southern Israel. A 7-year-old Bedouin girl suffered severe injuries. Some damage was caused to an air force base in the South. The rest of the munition fired at Israel was intercepted with a success rate of close to 99 percent. A significant portion of the threats were intercepted outside of Israeli territory, in the skies over Jordan and Iraq (where most of the operations were conducted by the U.S.).\\n\\n>**The importance of the results of this nocturnal conflict must not be underestimated. They are an unprecedented achievement in the history of Israel's wars – albeit with some help from friends – that largely takes away the main card held by Iran and the axis: drones and missiles. The impressive Arrow System interceptions have garnered most of the attention, but Israeli and American pilots downed hundreds of cruise missiles and drones.**\\n\\n>**One can assume that Tehran is extremely disappointed with the results. The Iranian intention, as evaluated ahead of the attack, was to put on a display of its capabilities with an attack on military targets. An analysis of the areas in which warnings were sounded suggests the target could have been the Nevatim Air Base in southern Israel. It appears that the Iranians planned to destroy the base and the advanced F-35 fighter jets stationed there, which are the crown jewel of American aid to Israel. Iran failed completely.**\", 'score': 34, 'post_id': '1c3x0pj', 'post_title': '/r/WorldNews Live Thread: Iran attacks Israel (Thread 4)'}\n",

Here\\'s information from an independent source that sheds light on the topic of embassies and consulates:\\n\\n1. **Embassies and Consulates: A Comparison**:\\n   - An **embassy** is a diplomatic mission representing one country within the territory of another country. It serves as the official residence and workplace of the ambassador and diplomatic staff, facilitating communication and negotiations between the two governments. Embassies also provide consular services and promote cultural, educational, and trade relations.\\n   - A **consulate**, on the other hand, is a diplomatic office located in a foreign city (usually outside the capital where the embassy is situated). Consulates primarily focus on providing consular services to citizens of their home country living or traveling in the host country.\\n   - Contrary to popular belief, neither embassies nor consulates are considered sovereign territory. They operate on foreign soil while remaining under the sovereignty of the host country¹.\\n\\n2. **Legal Framework**:\\n   - The **Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961** governs embassies. It grants diplomatic agents immunity from arrest, detention, civil and criminal jurisdiction, and tax exemptions, allowing them to carry out their duties without interference from the host country.\\n   - Consulates, governed by the **Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 1963**, have a more limited set of privileges and immunities, as their primary focus is on consular services¹.\\n\\n3. **Myth Debunked**:\\n   - Despite misconceptions, embassies and consulates are **not sovereign soil** of the representing nation. They exist within the host country\\'s territory, benefiting from diplomatic privileges but remaining subject to the host country\\'s laws and sovereignty¹.\\n\\nFor further exploration, you can refer to this detailed article on [Consulate vs. Embassy: A Comparison](https://pathtoforeignservice.com/consulate-vs-embassy-a-comparison/). 🌐🏛️', 'score': 3, 'post_id': '1c3u3ov', 'post_title': 'The New York Times: Netanyahu dropped retaliation against Iran after Biden call'}\n",
